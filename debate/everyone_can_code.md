# Alan Turing Institute

“I think it likely that in ten years’ time every undergraduate programme will
have to include some teaching in data science”.

Professor Sir Adrian Smith FRS, Alan Turing Institute Director and Chief
Executive, 2019

# What is Data Science?

Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning
and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual
phenomena" with data.

Hayashi, Chikio (1 January 1998). "What is Data Science? Fundamental Concepts
and a Heuristic Example"

# What is Data Science?

"With this in mind, I would encourage you to think of data science not as a new
domain of knowledge to learn, but a new set of skills that you can apply within
your current area of expertise."

Preface to Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas

# What is Data Science?

* Coding
* Stats
* Domain expertise

Oh, and it's not just for scientists, but all researchers.

# Premise

* There will come a time when all new university researchers will be able to code
* A researcher who codes will:
  * Do better research
  * Do quicker research
  * Do more reproducible research
  * Be able to supervise students who code

# Coding Goals

* Understand what algorithms are, how they are implemented as programs on
  digital devices, and that programs execute by following precise and
  unambiguous instructions;
* Create and debug simple programs;
* Use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs
* Use technology purposefully to create, organise, store, manipulate and
  retrieve digital content

# Coding is not a specialist skill

* Understand what algorithms are, how they are implemented as programs on
  digital devices, and that programs execute by following precise and
  unambiguous instructions;
* Create and debug simple programs;
* Use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs
* Use technology purposefully to create, organise, store, manipulate and
  retrieve digital content

[National curriculum in computing](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study): Key stage 1 (5-7 year olds).

# Coding is for everyone!

* Gone are the days when coding was just for techies.
* It's in the primary school curriculum
* => In 15 years' time all PhD students will have done it at primary school

# Why does it matter?

* Store your data in Excel
* Manually edit it, make forumlae, make charts
* Include charts and results in paper

## Reinhart, Rogoff... and Herndon: The student who caught out the profs
> "Economists have been astonished to find that a famous academic paper often used to make the case for austerity cuts contains major errors."

# If you did it in Python, R, MATLAB, ...

* Code / data separation (=> don't edit the raw data)
* Use the code to test the data
* Get the right results
