# Coding is a standalone skill

* There are whole 20 credit modules on coding.
* That's 200 hours of work.
* Even after that, it will take [10
  years](https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html).
* Specialists know lots of tricks to write better code,
  that we don't have time to learn.
* No one we are working with codes, so why learn?

# GUIs are totally fine

* Clever people have considered helpless non-coders like
  ourselves.
* They have written nicely designed GUIs to do the common
  tasks.
* You can get nearly all the way with the GUI.
* If not, someone's about to write a new GUI (it's nearly
  \2020).

# A specialist can come and help out

* Our subjects are super-easy.
* Programming is super-hard.
* We can ask a clever programmer to do the hard stuff.  How
  hard can it be to explain psychology / biology
  / hydrology / New Testament Greek?
* That's the most efficient
