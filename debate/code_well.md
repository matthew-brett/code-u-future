# Thinking straight is not easy

* Coding is expressed in language.
* If the language is not clear, you will make more
  mistakes.
* Mistakes are very common.
* Mistakes mean wrong results, confusion, and wasted time.

# Good programming is good science

*   If you can program well, your results are

    * More likely to be correct
    * Easier to check
    * Easier to extend
    * Easier to share

# Good programming saves you time

* You write correct code more quickly.
* You gain by collaboration.
* You can deal with more difficult problems.
* You are less likely to go down blind alleys.

# Programming without improving is wasted time

* If you learn how to learn, you will continually improve.
* You can more easily work with people who can teach you.
* You can lose a colossal amount of time by continuing to
  write code badly.
