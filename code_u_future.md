Software engineering is now a life skill. Gone are the days when coding was just
for techies. Today coding is a core part of the primary school curriculum where
it is taught alongside reading, writing and arithmetic. We argue that the day is
coming when job applicants for a wide range of roles will be at a significant
advantage if they can code. Moreover, we argue that this is already the case for
the majority of research positions at the University. Indeed, for example, ZZZ
has already decided (based on his experience of work done by researchers in his
research group) that he will no longer recruit people who cannot code.

The question then is "why is it so important to be able to code?" What benefits
does it bring to a researcher?

The fundamental point is that a researcher who can code will be able to
manipulate, analyse, visualise and interpret data faster and better than a
researcer who cannot code. They will do the job both faster and better.

If graduates of the University leave with coding skills they will be more
employable. If research students at the University gain these skills then they
will be more employable, but also the many who stay on to become post-doctoral
researchers here will improve the quality and quantity of the University's
research outputs.

What we set out in this document is a proposal of how to get there.
